# PHP based web application 


This web application uses PHP for the backend and SQL server Database. The data used is dummy and is stored under the model folder.

* Currently the web application performs few basic tasks:

1. When the user gives nationality as the input, all the artists of that nationality along with their recently released album.
2. When we click on the artist from above output, it displays all the Songs by that artist.

### <ins>Implementation on Windows</ins>:
              1. First create a database connect using sqlsrv in PHP to SQL server.
              2. Since, this web application has limited tasks it performs on, the front-end has also been designed using HTML combined with PHP.
